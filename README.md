# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python repository! This repository documents my journey of improving my Python skills through daily coding exercises and projects. Over the course of 100 days, I will be working on various Python topics, completing coding challenges, and building real-world applications.

## Motivation

Python is an incredibly versatile and powerful programming language used in a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation. The goal of this challenge is to enhance my Python proficiency by dedicating consistent practice and learning opportunities.

## Structure

This repository is organized into separate folders for each day of the challenge. Within each folder, you will find the code solutions, projects, and a log of my progress. Here's an overview of the structure:

- **Day 001:** [Description of the exercise or project]
- **Day 002:** [Description of the exercise or project]
- ...
- **Day 100:** [Description of the exercise or project]

Feel free to explore the folders and code files to see my progress throughout the challenge.

## Progress Tracking

To keep track of my progress, I am using the following methods:

- **GitHub:** I am utilizing this repository to store my daily code solutions, projects, and a log of my progress. Each day's folder contains the code files and any additional resources or documentation related to the exercise or project.
